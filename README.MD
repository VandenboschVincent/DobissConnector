# Dobiss MQTT Bridge for Home Assistant

A lightweight .NET bridge for connecting a **Dobiss light control system** to an **MQTT broker**, enabling seamless integration with **Home Assistant**. The application also includes a **REST API** to monitor and control lights directly when MQTT is not used.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Communicates with Dobiss lighting system via TCP
- Publishes light state and control topics to MQTT for Home Assistant integration
- Supports multiple Dobiss module types: `RELAY`, `DIMMER`, `ZERO_TO_TEN_VOLT`
- Exposes a REST API for manual control or integration without MQTT
- Configurable polling interval to sync light statuses
- Lightweight Docker container support

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is provided through `appsettings.json`. Below is a sample:

```json
{
  "dobiss": {
    "Delay": 5000,
    "Modules": {
      "1": "RELAY",
      "2": "DIMMER",
      "3": "RELAY"
    },
    "DobissIp": "192.168.1.153",
    "DobissPort": 10001
  },
  "mqtt": {
    "Ip": "192.168.1.34",
    "Port": 1883,
    "User": "",
    "Password": ""
  }
}
````

### üîå `dobiss` Configuration

| Field        | Type   | Description                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Delay`      | int    | Polling interval in milliseconds. Set to `0` to disable status polling.                 |
| `Modules`    | object | Map of module numbers to their types. Supported: `RELAY`, `DIMMER`, `ZERO_TO_TEN_VOLT`. |
| `DobissIp`   | string | IP address of the Dobiss controller.                                                    |
| `DobissPort` | int    | Port number of the Dobiss controller (default: `10001`).                                |

### üì° `mqtt` Configuration (Optional)

| Field      | Type   | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Ip`       | string | IP address of the MQTT broker.                    |
| `Port`     | int    | MQTT port (default: `1883`).                      |
| `User`     | string | MQTT username (leave empty for anonymous access). |
| `Password` | string | MQTT password (leave empty for anonymous access). |

## üß™ API

The REST API is available if enabled in your environment and provides endpoints to interact with the light system.

| Method | Endpoint                            | Description                        |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/light`                            | Returns a list of all light states |
| GET    | `/light/{module}/{key}`             | Get status of a specific light     |
| POST   | `/light/{module}/{key}/toggle`      | Toggle a light on/off              |
| POST   | `/light/{module}/{key}/set/{value}` | Set light state (0 = off, 1 = on)  |
| POST   | `/light/{module}/{key}/dim/{value}` | Set dim level (0‚Äì100 for DIMMER)   |

> Replace `{module}` and `{key}` with the correct identifiers for your Dobiss modules and outputs.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vandenboschvincent/dobissconnector.git
   cd dobiss-mqtt-bridge
   ```

2. **Configure the app**
   Edit `appsettings.json` to reflect your Dobiss system and MQTT broker.

3. **Build and run**


### üê≥ Docker

To run using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name dobiss-connector \
  -v /path/to/your/appsettings.json:/app/appsettings.json \
  -p 5000:80 \
  vandenboschvincent/dobissconnectorserviceapp
```

* Replace `/path/to/your/appsettings.json` with the full path to your local config.
* Ensure port `5000` (or any mapped port) is exposed if you plan to access the API.
